## The assignment includes:

2. It is fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile views.
3. It follows the same fonts, typography, and styling as the original.
4. I have used reusable themes/colors via Tailwind CSS for easy maintainability.

1. I have replaced the existing lilac theme
2. I have replaced the existing font with a new one that fits well with the design
3. I have selected a new color palette different from the current palette (primary, secondary, accent) that is cohesive and aesthetically pleasing.
4. I have updated all elements (images, backgrounds, text, buttons, etc.) to use the new colors consistently.
5. The new theme maintains readability (e.g., sufficient contrast) and visual balance.
6. The new theme is applied consistently across: Text, Buttons, Sections, and UI elements
